Did you know that aptitude, the apt utility, has a hidden game? That's minesweeper, and it can be an entertaining way to pass your time while ugrading packages.

To play mineseeper, start aptitude with no parameters.
{% highlight bash %}
$ aptitude
{% endhighlight %}

Then press Control + T to open the actions menu, select Play Minesweeper and press Enter.

You can place flags by pressing F.

Ok, that's what you need to know, go have fun!
